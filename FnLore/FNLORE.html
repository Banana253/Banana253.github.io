                use the battle royale formula that was popular at the time of release, 100 players would jump off a bus
                and sky dive to a set of <abbr title="Point of Interest">POIs</abbr> set on an island, as the game
                continues the safe area gets smaller and smaller by a danger zone called <i>"The Storm"</i>, at the end
                of the game the last person standing wins. The game uses a season system for major updates new
                battle passes, these seasons are then spilt up into chapters, so far we have had four chapters,
                Chapter 1 running from September of 2017 to October of 2019 with a total of ten seasons, Chapter
                2 running from October of 2019 to December of 2021 with a total of eight seasons, Chapter 3
                running from December of 2021 to December of 2022 with a total of four seasons, Chapter 4 from
                December of 2022 to Current day so far with four seasons with a rumored fifth season for five in

            <p id="writeup">Lore Wise, there is no lore due to this being the first season of
                battle
                royale and lore wasn't yet introduced to the game. There also isn't a season tagline so I added my own.

            <p class="text-break" id="writeup">In terms of lore this season did technically add the island so there is
                that. This season doesn't have anything going on, it's mainly here just so it doesn't start at season 3
                when lore really started. In early BR there was a theory that BR was just a training simulation for STW,
                which would make sense before the lore became it's own thing.</p>

                The first interesting thing is that the battle pass contains a hand full of space related items which
