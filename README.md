This is a project mainly for learning html, and I guess github while I'm at it. My code may be kinda odd and thats because I'm learning. I'm fully aware that there are ways to do this better.

This site uses Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com/

The DarkMode Toggle was created by: han109k

I added a web build of a Binyot Bird so heres the credits for that project:

The base of this Flappy Bird clone is by Coding With Russ. I followed the tutorial then added my own bits to it and made it Vinesauce Vinny themed, I need help :).

MORTIS Grahpic and Sound from "FAITH" by Airdorf.

Plate Breaking sound from the Real Time Corruptor by Redscientist Labs. (It could be a stock sfx, but RTC is what I took it from.)

Bird Sprit Edit and Meat by Banana253.

That should be all needed credits, I hope. I thought I wrote down what needed credits but I can't find it.
