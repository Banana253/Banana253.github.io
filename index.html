        <p class="bodytext">Welcome to my homepage, this page is here to link all my other pages together. If you've
            been to this site before you might notice some missing elements, I've removed the other pages from the site
            for the time being as I'm rewriting code to not use Bootstrap and use my own CSS rules. That means for now
            this page goes nowhere, I still haven't finished rewriting this page so things are bound to change. Im still
            learning HTML and CSS so things will be jank.</p>
